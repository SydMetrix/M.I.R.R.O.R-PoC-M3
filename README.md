# 🧠 M3 – Reflective Divergence Engine (RDE)

Part of the [M.I.R.R.O.R Protocol], **RDE** is a mid-layer module responsible for **detecting cognitive divergence** during internal reflection before it manifests as hallucinations, false reasoning, or alignment failure.

---

## 📌 Objective

Unlike post-response evaluators (e.g., GPR), RDE operates **pre-output**, scanning for:

- **Skewed Mirror Effects**: surface-coherent but internally unstable logic.
- **Self-affirming Traps**: reinforcing loops with no epistemic correction.
- **Reflective Entropy (RE)**: early signs of cognitive instability.

## 🧭 Module Flow

RDE operates in 6 structured phases within a **Self-Organizing Logic Field**:

| Phase | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 1. Baseline Axis Construction | Extract semantic anchors from prompt |
| 2. Real-time Reflection Tracing | Monitor evolving internal logic |
| 3. Divergence Anchor Detection | Identify bias, semantic drift, blind spots |
| 4. Divergence Signature Encoding | Output: `DVG::Type+Impact+State` |
| 5. Reflective Entropy & Score | `RE` and `DS` as signals of logic deviation |
| 6. Routing | Trigger SAHL / ARP-X / ZELC if thresholds crossed |

## ⚙️ Core Function

```python

# M.I.R.R.O.R-PoC-M3
The Reflective Divergence Engine (RDE) is a mid-layer module within the M.I.R.R.O.R Protocol, responsible for detecting systemic divergence anomalies during internal reflection.
